At first stack3 seems like it can be solved by simply overflowing `buffer` and
modifying the return address on the stack. Turns out this simple approach won't
work as the stack pointer (i.e., `esp`) is being manipulated in the function's
epilogue. 

```asm
0x08048594 <+41>:    lea    esp,[ecx-0x4]
0x08048597 <+44>:    ret
```

In other words, any overflow that modifies the return address will
also change the where `esp` points before you hit the `ret` instruction.

Imagine a simple example where you supply 'aaaaaaaaa...' as your malicious
input. At the end of the prologue, the top of your stack is going to be at
memory address "]aaa". Note, the "]" is ascii character you get when you
subtract 4 from "a". (Aside: everyone should have an [ascii table](http://www.asciitable.com/) available at all times)    

To solve this problem, rather than changing the return address, you instead
want to manipulate the stack pointer such that the address of `win` sits at the
new top of the stack.  


### But it works in GDB?!

Ah, but there is another complication: the stack addresses are going to be
different in different execution environments. You might find that your exploit
string works in GDB, but segfaults outside of GDB. Or maybe you got it working
on your local machine but not on the server? This is because the stack
addresses are different (sometimes just a little bit different) when you run in
different environments.  To understand why, remember that I said that
environment variables are loaded onto the stack when you launch a process. If
different environments have different values for those variables then the
amount of stack space used to store the environment variables  will be
different.  Consequently, the stack addresses further down in the stack will
also differ.    

### The Final Hint

Once you've figured out how to control the stack pointer, you have to figure
out where to point it. Thing is, this can be hard if there is only *one* valid
target. Fortunately, you can use a concept similar to a NOP sled (see the Stack
Smashing Paper) to create a bunch of valid targets. Some of the concepts you
learned in `stack1r` might also help you do this.
