Let's put everything together that we learned so far exploit our first binary
using shellcode. The basic attack described in "Smashing the Stack" looks like
this:


```
Start of                                                Saved
Buffer                                                  Return Addr
   +                                                        +
   |                                                        |
   v                                                        v

   +------------------+-------------------------------------+-----+
   |    NOP Sled      |     Shellcode                       | Addr|
   +------+-----------+-------------------------------------+---+-+
          ^                                                     |
          |                                                     |
          +-----------------------------------------------------+

```

The challenges here are to figure out:
 - how much padding to add to overwrite the saved return address on the stack
 - what address to jump to, i.e., where is our shellcode?

The NOP sled is intended to help us with the second problem because it allows
us to jump to any one of X addreses, where X is the length of the NOP sled.
Without the NOP sled, we'd have to guess the exact location of the shellcode
and that could take a really long time.


### The Easy-ish Way

We are going to do things a little differently than what is described in
"Smashing the Stack". Personally, I think my way is much easier to understand.
Note, the details given below will differ from what you will encounter on the
course infrastructure as these notes were originally written for an older
setup.

To maximize our chances of success we are going to use a NOP sled. Unlike the
method described in "Smashing the Stack" we are going to make our sled as big
as possible by utilizing the entire stack for our exploit. Let's do some
back-of-napkin math to plan our attack.

A quick check via GDB tells us that start of the vulnerable buffer is at
0xbffff790. When we run the program outside of gdb that value will likely be
different, but it gives us a place to start. Further, a glance at the memory
map tells us that the stack ends at address 0xC0000000. A
little subtraction tells us that we have approximately 2160 bytes worth of
stack to work with. The specific GDB commands that I used to calculate this
information are:


```
disass *main

//put a breakpoint before the call to gets
break *0x080483d4

//run it
r

//find the end of the stack
info proc mappings 

//find the start of the buffer via eax
info registers

//substract!
p 0xC0000000 - 0xbffff790

```


Let's draw what the stack will look like once we overflow the buffer.

```
start                                              end
of buff                                            of stack
  |                                                  |
  v                                                  v
   ~100 bytes            ~1500 bytes        ~100 bytes
  +----------+----------------------------+----------+
  |addr sled |   NOP sled                 | shellcode|
  ++---------+--------------+-------------+----------+
   |                        ^
   |                        |
   +------------------------+
        Point to the
        middle of the
        NOP sled


```

Rather than bother to calculate the exact distance between the start of the
vulnerable buffer and the return address, we are instead going to overwrite the
saved return value by using a repeated sequence of addresses.  In this case, we
want the new return value to point into the NOP sled; specifically, we want to
target the middle of the NOP sled. Let's just make a rough guess and say that
the middle of the sled is probably about 1000 bytes from the end of the stack.
Some subtraction tells us that address is 0xbffffc18 (or so). 

Let's test if our guess worked using the `int3` instruction (0xcc) to trigger a
breakpoint (instead of using shellcode):

```
python -c "print '\x18\xfc\xff\xbf'*25 + '\x90'*1500 + '\xcc'" | ./stack4
```

We know it succeeded because we see the output "Trace/breakpoint trap".  

The last thing  we need to do is replace the `int3` payload without NOP sled
and shellcode. I'll leave that part to you.
