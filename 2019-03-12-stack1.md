If you are new to the concept of environment variables---or just want to brush
up a bit---take a look at the following links:

 - [Understanding environment variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html)
 - [Different ways to set environment variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html)
 - [Understanding back ticks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48392/understanding-backtick)

Also, consider using Python to generate your input strings; `python -c` is
especially useful.
