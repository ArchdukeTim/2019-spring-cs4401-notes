### Course Catalog Description

This course provides an introduction to the pitfalls and practices of building
secure software applications. Topics will include threat modeling, secure
software development, defensive programming, web security, and the interaction
between security and usability. The course focuses on the application level
with minor attention to operating-system level security; network-level security
is not covered. Assignments involve designing and implementing secure software,
evaluating designs and systems for security-related flaws, and presentations on
security issues or tools. All students will be required to sign a pledge of
responsible conduct at the start of the course.

## Course Policies and Procedures

The following represent the official policies and procedures for the course.
Please review this information and, if you have questions, discuss them with
the professor as soon as possible.

### Official Communication

Class discussion, class hand-outs, emails to the studentâ€™s WPI email account,
and the course Web pages are avenues for official course communication.
Students are responsible for any information posted through these venues.

### Textbooks

We will not be using an assigned textbook in this course. Students will be
responsible for obtaining the reading from the links provided by the instructor
and, if needed, printing it out for reading.


### Course Participation and Professionalism

During lectures, students are to be focused on the course. Students should not
use materials or electronic devices that would inhibit their attention to the
course lecture and discussion. Laptops should only be used for note-taking
and relevant in-class activities.

Students must treat each other and the teaching staff with respect at all
times. Disagreement, debates, and criticism of ideas are healthy aspects of
academic environments; however, students should be careful to avoid demeaning
language or personal attacks. The ability to handle conflict professionally and
work with a variety of people is an acquired skill, yet it is increasingly
important in technical careers.

### Student Disabilities

If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, or if
you have medical information to share with me, please talk with
me as soon as possible. If you have not already done so, students with
disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are
encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) as soon as
possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely
fashion. This office is located in Daniels Hall and their phone number is
508-831-4908.

### Academic Honesty

The [WPI Academic Honesty Policy][honesty] describes types of academic
dishonesty and requirements in documentation. In the case of academic
dishonesty, I am required to report the incident to the Dean of Student
Affairs. Further, my penalty for academic dishonesty is to assign a failing
grade for the course.
