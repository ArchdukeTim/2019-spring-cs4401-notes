To be successful in _CS4401: Software Security Engineering_, it is expected that you already have a working
knowledge of the following tools and topics:

- C Programming Language
  - Pointers
  - String representation
- Memory Layout of C Programs:
  - Stack mechanics and purpose
  - Heap mechanics and purpose
  - Endianness
- x86 and x86-64 Assembly
- Reverse-engineering a program from its assembly
- GDB (or any other debugging tool such as Radare2)
- Basics of file permissions
- Unix Terminal

The content of this course builds upon this skillset that may have been acquired
through _CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts_, _CS2011: Machine Organization
and Assembly Language_, and _CS3013: Operating Systems._ It is highly recommended
to review these topics, **especially assembly language and reverse-engineering**
prior to the first day of class, as they are **critical** to completion of
our coursework.
