One of the most commonly deployed defenses is **address space layout
randomization (ASLR)**. As the name suggests, ASLR randomizes the address space
layout to make it difficult for attackers to find gadgets, the address of libc
functions, the objects on the stack, and the objects in the heap. Intuitively,
if the attacker does not know these addresses than constructing a working
exploit becomes significantly more difficult.


While there are many different proposed and implemented variations of ASLR this
post will focus on the [version proposed by the PAX
team](https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt) and implemented in Linux 32-bit
and 64-bit systems.


### The Basics 

In 32-bit Linux, ASLR randomizes the starting locating for three areas of memory: 
 - the **executable area** which contains the code, initialized data, and
   unitiliated data,
 - the **mapped area** which contains dynamically linked libraries, the heap,
   and thread stacks, 
 - and the **stack area** which contains the main user stack. 

The starting location for each area, also called the base offset, is selected
randomly for each area at process start. In other words, each region will be
given a different base offset for each execution of the program. 

There are restrictions for what those random offsets can be.  Take the mapped
area for example, while the base address is a 32-bit number ASLR will only
randomize bits 12-27. ASLR won't randomize bits 0-11 because it would break
page alignment and it won't randomize bits 28-31 because that would make it
harder to allocate big pages.  [1][aslr-problems]. As a result of these
restrictions, there are only 2^16 possible starting offsets for the mapped
area. In other words, ASLR provides 16 bits of randomness for the mapped area.
The stack and executable areas have similar restrictions and ASLR provides 24
and 16 bits of randomness for those areas, respectively.


### Example

Now lets take a quick glance at what  ASLR actually looks like from the
perspective of a user on a 64-bit system. First, let's turn it on (though it is probably enabled
by default). To turn ASLR on in Ubuntu run `echo 2 | sudo tee
/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` and if you want to turn it off run `echo 0
| sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`. Now consider this simple C
program:


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argv, char **argc){
    int target = 42;
    printf("The address of target: %p\n", &target);
    return 0;
}
```

Save this code as `aslr.c` and compile it by running `gcc -c aslr.c`. Next,
link the .o file to create the executable by running `gcc aslr.o -o aslr`. Now
run the program a few times. You should see something like this:

```
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffde80b5e14
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7fff2bff9bb4
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffeae3f9a54
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffec254dde4
```

You can see that the address of target is different for every execution.  The
first 3 bits and the last 4 bits appear to be constant but the remaining bits
change for every execution. This is ASLR's doing. The variable target is placed
on the stack but every time we a start new process (by calling `./aslr`) the
stack is moved. 

Lets also look where libc (we're calling printf from this library) is located
with every new process. Run `ldd aslr` a few times and we get

```
$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcaa9f6000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3a5829c000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f3a58666000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffc7953c000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f58e459f000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f58e4969000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffdaccb0000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fd94bf69000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fd94c333000)
```

Again, the leading bits and the last 12 bits stay the same, however the
remaining bits are randomized.

### Defeating ASLR

Importantly, ASLR does not randomize *within* each area.  What does this
mean for security? To answer this question, let's consider a simple
return-to-libc attack that exploits a buffer overflow. To execute this attack,
the attacker needs to know the address of `system` (which is in the mapped
area) and the address of the attacker-supplied string to pass to system (which
is on the stack).  In a perfect world, this means the attacker has to deal
16+24 bits of randomness (on a 32-bit system), i.e., it is extremely unlikely
that the attacker will correctly guess the address of system  and the address
of the argument string in the randomize address space layout. Further, the
attacker has to get it right on the first try, otherwise the process will crash
and the new process will have a completely different random layout.  As Shacham
et al. point out in their seminal [paper][aslr-problems], in the real world
ASLR has a few problems.

The first problem is the one we mentioned above: ASLR does not randomize within
each area. This decision is great for performance and simplicity of
implementation, but once the attacker can determine one known address in the
area they effectively know all other addresses in that area. For example, the
functions `usleep` and `system` are always the same distance apart for the same
version of libc. So if the attacker figures out the address of `usleep` they
now know the address of `system` as well. This lack of internal randomization
is also a problem on the stack and the heap for similar reasons.  

So how does the attacker learn figure out one of these addresses? One way is
through a memory leak. For example, an attacker can use a format string
vulnerability to print out the contents of the stack and the stack contains
pointers into both the *executable area* (e.g., saved return addresses) and the
*stack area* (e.g., saved frame pointers). Another technique, described by
Shacham et al, is to guess until you get it right. It might seem like 1 in 2^16
is bad odds for the attacker,  But to understand why the guessing technique
works we have to understand the next major problem with ASLR.   

The second problem is that ASLR randomizes at function start but does not
re-randomize on a process fork. In other words, the forked process will have
the exact same layout as the parent process. While there are 2^16=65,536
possible locations for `system`, with forking the attacker can guess all
possible locations.  In the Shacham paper, they describe how this problem leads
to an attacker being able to exploit a webserver by guessing the locations
needed for a return-to-libc attack---the whole attack only requires  a few
minutes of guessing to succeed.

Fortunately, the guessing attack described above becomes impractical on 64-bit 
systems given the much much much larger address space.


### Final Thoughts 

You might wonder what's the point of an information leak if your exploit is
statically crafted and all of those addresses you leak will change once
execution ends. There exists tools, like pwntools, that you can use to start a
new process, read output from the program, and programmatically craft your
exploit string for the process based on the output obtained. If you want to
learn more read the post on pwntools.

Attackers can also spray the heap with hundreds useful gadgets (`pop rdi` for
instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode (a trick that attackers use
in their shellcode is replacing the string `/bin/sh` for `////////bin/sh` to
increase their chances of running the command with `system`). While heap
spraying doesn't guarantee success for the attacker it increases its chances.
The attacker would also have to circumvent additional defenses such as DEP
(data execution prevention) which makes sure that code inside the heap is not
executed. On Ubuntu DEP is done via the NX bit (non-executable bit) which
signals which regions of memory are not executable. If you wish you to learn
