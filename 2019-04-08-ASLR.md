One of the most popular ways to defend against exploits is by randomizing the
address space layout. This makes it difficult for attackers to find gadgets,
any of address of a libc function, the stack, and the heap by changing the
position of key data structures and libraries with every new process spawned.
If an attacker attempted to brute force, its chances of hitting all the right
addresses is 1 in millions (if you want to learn more about the actual
probability check out this [link](https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt) 
for the actual calculations) in a 32-bit system. The chances are even slimmer 
for an attacker to succeeded via trial and error with a 64-bit address space. Modern 
systems also include other restrictions such as preventing a program from
executing for a fixed amount of time if it has crashed a given number of
times. This will further hinder attackers with more sophisticated brute force
attacks. For example, for a return-to-libc attack you only need ONE address
pertaining to libc to find any function in the shared library. The offsets are
always fixed even if the base address of libc is randomized.

### Example

We will show a quick example of what ASLR does. First, lets turn it on. To turn
ASLR on in Ubuntu run `echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` and
if you want to turn it off run `echo 0 | sudo tee
/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`. Now consider this simple C program:


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argv, char **argc){
    int target = 42;
    printf("The address of target: %p\n", &target);
    return 0;
}
```

save it as `aslr.c` and compile it by running `gcc -c aslr.c`. Next, link 
the .o file to create the executable by running `gcc aslr.o -o
aslr`. Now ran the program a few times. You will see something like this:

```
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffde80b5e14
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7fff2bff9bb4
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffeae3f9a54
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffec254dde4
```
you can see the first 3 bits are constant but the remaining ones are completely
random. This is ASLR's doing. The variable target is placed on the stack but
every time we a new process by calling `./aslr` the stack is moved. Lets also
look where libc (we're calling printf from this library) is located with every
new process. Run `ldd aslr` a few times and we get

```
$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcaa9f6000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3a5829c000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f3a58666000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffc7953c000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f58e459f000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f58e4969000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffdaccb0000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fd94bf69000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fd94c333000)
```

Again, the first couple bytes stay the same, however the remaining ones are
randomized.

### Defeating ASLR

ASLR is unfortunately not the silver bullet that will strike down binary exploits like
buffer overflows and return-to-libc attacks. This defense can be easily
defeated if the attacked binary has an information leak. This means, that the
program exposes addresses that allows the attacker to find, for example, the
stack, the heap, or some function in libc. A very basic example of an
information leak is using `printf` without `%s` when taking in user input. An attacker
using `%x` multiple times as input can leak addresses pertaining to the stack
as well as the canary, another security mitigation technique. 

You might wonder what's the point of knowing this information if those addresses will change
once execution ends. There exists tools, like pwntools, that can start a new
process, read output from the program, and programmatically craft input for
the process based on the output obtained. If you want to learn more read the
post on pwntools.

Attackers can also spray the heap with hundreds useful gadgets (`pop rdi` for
instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode (a trick that attackers use
in their shellcode is replacing the string `/bin/sh` for `////////bin/sh` to
increase their chances of running the command with `system`). While heap
spraying doesn't guarantee success for the attacker it increases its chances.
The attacker would also have to circumvent additional defenses such as DEP
(data execution prevention) which makes sure that code inside the heap is not
executed. On Ubuntu DEP is done via the NX bit (non-executable bit) which
signals which regions of memory are not executable. If you wish you to learn
