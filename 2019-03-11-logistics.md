### Your Account

When creating your account---though I'm not sure this post is visible without
an account---make sure to use your WPI username, e.g., `rjwalls`. Otherwise, I
won't know who is who and some people won't get graded. 

**Make sure to join the `CS4401` classroom with teacher `rjwalls`.** If you
don't I will not be able to track your current progress (and, thus, you won't
get graded).  

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

By the next class you must sign the [ethical hacking agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to acknowledge
that you will not use the skills you acquire in this course to break the law. 


### In-Class Participation

As part of lecture, I will select students at random to answer questions. Based
on the quality and frequency of this participation, you may be given additional
challenge points, hints, or other rewards. You can opt-out of being selected by
sending me an email with the reason for opt-out; for example, you may feel
nervous talking in front of crowds.  

### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the Course Infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Any attacks will be
met with appropriate displinary actions, including but not limited to, failing
the course and notifying the university and local law enforcement. If you
notice a flaw or potential exploit, please notify me directly and do not
attempt to exploit it.
