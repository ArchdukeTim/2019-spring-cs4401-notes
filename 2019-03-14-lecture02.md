Last lecture we introduced the concept of buffer overflows and solved our first
challenge problem. We saw how a miscreant can leverage external input and a bug
to exploit a program. This required us to understand how memory is laid out
and, more specifically,  how we can manipulate local variables on the stack.

We also started to see that what's executed on the machine is a couple of
layers of abstraction away from the C code (which itself is a couple of steps
away from what the programmer intended).  


### Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit

Last lecture, I assigned the classic "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" as
your reading. I only expect you to be able to understand up to the section on
"Shell Code" currently, but you will be learning that soon as well. In the
meantime, I want to clarify a few points from the first few sections of the
reading.

#### Defining Buffers

First, the way Aleph One defines buffer is different from how I defined it in
the last lecture. He defines a buffer as a "contiguous block of computer memory
that holds multiple instances of the same data type", whereas I define a buffer
more as a "contiguous block of memory associated with a data type." The
difference here is minor, but my definition is more broad in that it allows us
to refer to the four bytes associated with a single
integer has as a buffer also. 




#### Memory Permissions

Second, he talks about about the code region of memory being marked as
read-only. We didn't discuss memory permissions last class, but many of you
have probably come across this idea before in past classes (e.g., we talk at
length about this in the undergraduate operating systems course). Last time we
defined memory as a long contiguous sequences of bytes where each byte is
associated with an address. Each address (through the magic of paging) is also
associated with a set of permissions that specify whether that memory location
can be read from, written to, or executed. These are analgolous to the read,
write, and execute permissions that you see associated with files and file
systems.  If you see the dreaded segmentation fault, then you are attempting to
violate these permissions. 


#### Overwriting the Code Region

An understanding of memory permissions  also helps us answer another question
you might be thinking: "if the process's code is just sitting in memory, can an
attacker use a buffer overflow to change that code? The answer is usually "no"
here for a variety of reasons. First, the code typically lives in a memory
region that is marked as read-only.  Second, our stack-based buffer overflow
can only change memory that is above the buffer while the code region typically
lies below the stack. Of course, you'll soon learn about a more powerful form
of memory corruption, often referred a **write-what-where** vulnerability, that
we can leverage to write to any address in memory (modulo read-only permissions
and unmapped memory). Further, in many cases, if we have a write-what-where
vulnerability we can actually manipulate the program to such a degree that we
can change memory permissions.  

#### Code Injection

If, as an attacker, you can't overwrite/modify the existing code for a process,
then the logical next step to supply you own malicious code. This class of
attack is generally referred to as **code injection**. That is what the "Shell
Code" section of smashing the stack is about.

A successful attack requires more than just inserting malicious code
(once again, via  external input, not by modifying the binary), you also have
to trick the process into executing that code. More on this in a bit. 

Later on, we will talk about how you can use memory permissions to protect
against code injection.


### Stack Frames

Third, he talks about the stack frame, a concept that we skirted around last
lecture. Stack frames are not too complicated, we can define them as the
section of the stack associated with a single function call. Every time a
function is called, a new stack frame is created. Setting up that stack frame
involves a number of steps, some of which are the responsibility  of the caller
and some are the responsibility of the callee. Once again this behavior is
defined by the **calling convention** and varies from system to system.
Importantly, the instructions in each function responsible for stack frame
setup and tear-down are referred to as the function prologue and epilogue,
respectively. 


### Spilling Registers

The prologue and epilogue are also used to setup registers for use. Remember
that there are only a small number of registers that a function can use, and
all functions use those registers. Once again this depends on the architecture,
this means that a function may have to save the previous value of a register
before it can be used, i.e., save and restore the value so when the previous
function executes the register still contains the value that it expects.

Where are these registers saved? On the stack of course. You may hear this
process referred to as **register spilling**. Have we seen this behavior in the
programs we've looked at so far? Yep, we've seen register spilling used for the
`ebp` register. Register spilling is another reason why the return address by
maybe further away from the start of the buffer than you would think based on
the C code.
 

### Outside of Address Space

Aleph One makes a confusing statement when talking about the segmentation fault
caused by the buffer overflow. Specifically, the address "0x41414141" (the hex
representation of ascii "AAAA") is "outside of the process address space" and
that is why your receive a segmentation fault. Last class, I said that the
process address space spans addresses from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e., all
addresses possible with a 32-bit address in a byte-addressable system). The
"AAAA" address certainly falls in that range. 

I think it is more accurate to say that the memory at address "AAAA" is not
mapped. In other words, the OS has not assigned any physical memory to process
that is associated with (or mapped to) that virtual address. As we discussed
last time, the virtual address space is an abstraction/illusion provided to the
process by the OS. Because the amount of physical memory is very limited
(especially when you consider that your machine may be running thousands of
processes concurrently), the OS only maps a small fraction of the process's
address space. 

To complicate matters future, the kernel reserves a portion of the address
space for itself.  On 32-bit x86 Linux systems, it is common for the first 3
GiB addresses  (3 times 2^30 addresses) to be usable by the process and the
last 1 GiB to be usable only by the OS. The cutoff address would then be
0xc0000000. 

In GDB you can view the mapped memory using `info proc map`. 

```
gdb /opt/protostar/bin/stack0
break *main
r
info proc map
```

Here we can see the memory regions we talked about last class. Notably, we have
the code region at the bottom and the stack at the top. We will ignore the rest
of the entries in this list for now. If you are looking closely, you might
notice something strange: last time I said the environment variables were at
the top of memory, but GDB tells us that the stack is pushed right up against
the boundary for kernel-only memory addresses (0xc0000000). This should tell
you that the environment variables actually live on the stack. 


### Intel v. At&t Syntax

Unfortunately, you are often going to see both Att and Intel syntax so you will
have to be comfortable with both.  GDB, objdump, and others use Att syntax by
default while IDA uses Intel syntax.

Here are some of the major differences:

```
                    ATT           Intel
operands            src, dst      dst, src
registers           %rbx          rbx
size suffix         movq          mov
location desc.      (%rbx)        QWORD PTR [rbx]
immediate           $0x1F         0x1F
```

The language for sizes is also confusing. This chart is for x86-64. Pointers
(`char *`) are only 4 bytes in x86-32.

```
C          Intel                  ATT Suffix    Size (bytes)
char       byte                   b             1
short      word                   w             2
int        dbl word               l             4
long       quad word              q             8
char\*     quad word              q             8
float      single precision       s             4
double     double precision       l             8
``` 



### Control-Flow Hijacking 


If, as an attacker, you can't overwrite/modify the existing code for a process,
then the logical next step to supply you own malicious code. This class of
attack is generally referred to as **code injection**. When that code launches
a shell (giving you a convient interface to the hacked machine), that injected
code is called **shell code** That is what the latter sections of smashing the
stack are about.

Writing shell code is not too hard but it requires knowledge of assembly, C
calling conventions, and calling convention for system calls. And you are going
to learn how to do all of that (hint:that is what your first project is going
to be about).  However, for now, lets focus on the first step: how do we can
trick the process into executing our injected code.

Broadly, this process is called **control-flow hijacking** and we already
figured out a one way to do this last lecture (though you may not have realized
it). Any guesses? Specifically, we modified the value of the return address
with our buffer overflow. When the vulnerable function finished its epilogue,
it executed the `ret` instruction which pops the return address off of the
stack and into the EIP register.

Let's make control-flow hijacking more concrete by look at our next challenge
binary.

#### Stack 2

Consider the code for stack2. It is remarkably similar to the code for stack0,
the big difference is that we know have a function pointer as one of the local
variables. Take a minute to think about how you might exploit this program
using what we have talked about so far.

```C

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}
```

Like our first challenge binary (stack0), we have a bug (the use of gets) that
will probably allow us to overwrite the buffer `buffer` and into the adjacent
`fp`.  This is easy to test by supplying a large input to the program. If `fp`
is not zero, then the conditional statement is statisfied and a message is
printed. 

We should also see a segmentation fault, because the process will then
try to execute the code at the modified value of `fp`---this is probably
address 0x61616161 if we use a lot of 'a's as our input. If we are clever about
how we craft our input, then we can make the process jump to any address we
want!

The next next step is to figure out the address of the win funcion. The first
column of the result for `x win` is exactly what we are looking for. Once we
know the address we just need to use it in the malicious input. This requires
us to know the distance between the start of the buffer and the start of fp.
Like we did with the first challenge, we can disassemble main, find the
relative stack locations and do some simple subtraction to figure this value
out.  

The start of `buffer` seems to be `esp+0x1c` and the start of `fp` seems to be
`esp+0x5c` based on our knowledge of the assembly instructions. This gives us a
distance of 64 bytes. We can now craft our malicious input. 

```bash
python -c "print 'a'*64 + '\x24\x84\x04\x08'" 
``` 

Importantly, we had to modify our input to account for the little endianess of
x86. Success! Note that actually appends a newline (check with `xxd`), but that
doesn't matter for this challenge. It might in the future though!

**Note:** The exactly addresses given above may different from what you see as
the most recent version of the challenge is built for a slightly different
system.


### Misc. Tips

[EpicTreasure][epic] is a wonderful docker image[^epicnote] that comes
preloaded with many useful CTF tools. I often use EpicTreasure to work on
challenge binaries on my local machine.

[^epicnote]: Even if it abuses the concept of what a Docker Images should be.

Another extremely useful tool is the [pwntools][pwn] python library (which is
also included by EpicTreasure).

**Disabling ASLR (temporarily):** 
`echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`.


**Why does the popped shell exit immediately?** Sometimes when you pop a shell,
it appears like nothing happened even though your shellcode seemed to execute.
This could occur because stdin is closed, causing the shell to exit
immediately. To fix this problem, you either get some fancy shell code (not
really that fancy) to reopen stdin, or you use the cat trick: 

```bash
(python exploit.py; cat) | ./vulnerable_prog 
```

**Check if the stack is executable:** 
 - `objdump -x foo`
 - Look in the "Program Header" section of the output.
 - Check the permission bits for the stack, e.g., "flags rw-"
 - "flags rw-" means the stack is not executable.

Alternatively, if you need to check if the **heap is executable**, you have to take
a more roundabout approach:
 - run `info proc map` inside of gdb to get the address of the heap
 - run the program outside of gdb and suspend it
 - get the pid of the suspended process using `ps -a`
 - get the memory map of the process using `pmap PID`
 - match the addresses (assuming no aslr), the heap might be labeled `anon` in
   `pmap`.


Some useful python code for working with numbers in different bases.

```python
ord('a')
bin(123)
hex(123)
int('111011101', 2)
"\x41ABCD".encode('hex')
```


Other notes:
 - Use the `int3` instruction to debug shellcode. It's simple to use, just throw
in the opcode 0xCC. The following is a good starter: `print '\x90'*100 + '\xCC'*4`.
 - Always have an ascii table handy: `man ascii`
 - Radare2 is a terminal-based disassembler that also supports debugging.
 - `strace` will give us the system calls used by a binary.
 - `ltrace` will give us the library call used by a binary, e.g., libc.
 - Nice x86-64 syscall reference [here](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/)


Common code areas (without aslr):
 - 64 bit:  0x40????
 - 32 bit: 0x80?????

Parameter passing to functions:
 - 64 bit: parameters are passed via registers, if you run out of registers,
   the rest of the params are put on the stack.
 - 32 bit: paramters are passed via the stack
